# Electic-Power-Steering-Integration-Module
An electronic device meant to seamlessly integrate a Toyota EPS into an 80's Toyota

The initial need for this project showed while retrofiting a 2006 Toyota Yaris (NPC9x) electric power steering column in a 1982 Toyota Corolla (TE72). The EPS comes from a non-ABS car and, according to information found online, needs a pulsed 5V speed signal input to engage steering assist. The TE72 has a mechanically driven speedometer and no ABS. So, no signal available to tap into. This project is for the development of a module that will integrate the EPS as seamlessly as possible with features such as:

- Electronically driven speedometer retrofit.
- PowerSteering assist starting once engine is running only.
- Adjustable power steering assist.
- Adjustable speedometer to compensate for differential ratio and tire diameter changes.
